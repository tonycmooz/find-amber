# Find Amber

## Using data science to find missing children
Game-changing technologies shouldn't just empower corporations. 2,000 children go missing every day in the United States and it is time to do something about it!

Let us scale the nation's current Amber Alert system. Using the abundance of traffic cameras, we can apply computer vision techniques to alert authorities to locate children that have been abducted.

## How so?
Team up with the Department of Justice and scale out the Amber Alert System with open source technologies like OpenCV. (https://www.amberalert.gov/)
By building real-time license plate and car recognition software, we can create text alerts to local police departments with detailed images, time of capture and location of the vehicle. They can then dispatch officers to find the child abductors and hopefully reunite these families.
